Welcome to my About Me page!

I am Chandler Lasater, I am 22 years old, and I live in Raleigh, North Carolina. I am in my third semester of the Applied Masters of Data Science program. 
I finished my Undergraduate Degree in Statistics in May of 2021. Now, I work as a Statistical Programmer at IQVIA, where I assist in data cleaning, 
preparation, and analysis for Clinical Trials. My ultimate career goal is to get into a Data Scientist or Data Analyst position, further down the road 
after completing my Masters. But, right now I love the job I have and am pleased with where I am at. My favorite hobbies are watching sports (huge NC State, 
Carolina Panthers, and Atlanta Braves fan), running (training for a half marathon!), and playing piano. 

I am most excited about learning some of the more advanced analytics techniques that I will learn in this class. I know that I am going to learn so many different
algorithms & methods for better exploring, understanding, and analyzing data, and I am super excited for that. Specifically, I think classification & clustering
will be the most exciting aspects of class that we are going to learn about. Data mining and exploration is my favorite part of the process, so I am excited to 
learn even more about it.

Looking forward to a great semester!
